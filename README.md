Lessons Learned
----------

### What went right
> After restarting my project in week 16, I was able to successfully create a database and connect to it within Visual Studio. After some initial setbacks with help from the instrcuctor I was able to scaffold the MVC components and begin building the application. 

### What went wrong
> After generating the database the foreign and primary keys did not transfer correctly, this led to problems when trying to query specific rows. 

### Where I got lucky
> I was lucky from the start of this application. I was able to connect and talk to my database on the first try despite a few minor migration issues. 

### What would you change
> As stated above, I changed my project in week 16 back to my original idea after gaining a better understanding of the development tools and programming language. At this point all I would change would be sticking with my original idea so that I had enough time to complete more of the listed requirements.
